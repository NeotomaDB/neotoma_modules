- The repository contains content designed for people to read.
    - A Jupyter Notebook 
    - An R script to make a visualization.

# What Do you Need to Build a Binder Repository?
**A BinderHub**

- Binders are powered by a BinderHub, an open-source tool that deploys the Binder service to the cloud.

- There are several BinderHubs that you may use:
    - [Binder Pangeo](https://binder.pangeo.io/)
    - [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/)
    - [Alan Turing Institute Binder](https://turing.mybinder.org/)
    - and [others](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/federation.html)

# Binder's Behind the Scenes
**repo2docker**

Binder uses a tool that mimics how humans do reproducible code **repo2docker**.

- It clones a github repository.

- It looks for configuration files 
    - These files describe the dependencies needed for the project.
    - It recognizes files named: `environment.yml`, `requirements.txt`, `install.R`, `Dockerfile`, and MORE.

- It installs the dependencies based on the configuration file.

- Starts a Jupyter Notebook / RStudio session.
