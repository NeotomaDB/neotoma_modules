## Copyright Law

In both the US and Canada, software code falls under copyright law.

The owner of the copyright can decide how this code may be used, copied, distributed, changed, among other activities.

Warning!
Copyright protects the language and words used to express ideas, concepts and themes.
It does not protect not the ideas, concepts or themes themselves.

## Who has copyright ownership? 

- You if you are author the code and you are doing this for yourself (i.e., not for your work)

- In such a case, you (the person who typed the code) automatically become the copyright owner.

    - In the USA, you do not need to use the copyright symbol Â© .

    - Best practices: Use the copyright symbol along with your name and the year of first publication.

    - Register tools that you publicate at USA Copyright Registration Portal

- The employer or client if you were doing a job for them.

- Implications if you would like to reuse a code that you did for your employer in a different situation:
    - Negotiate a licence to use the code you wrote.

## Why do I need a license?

As mentioned above, creative works (like software code) are automatically eligible for intellectual property (and thus copyright) protection

Reusing creative works without a license is dangerous, because the copyright holders could sue you for copyright infringement

Thus, if you publicly share your creative work (i.e., software code), you should let others know if and how they can reuse it

This is done via the inclusion of a LICENSE or LICENSE.txt file in the base directory of the repository that clearly states under which license the content is being made available

Unless you include a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation.

## How do licenses work?

A license grants rights to others (the licensees) that they would otherwise not have. What rights are being granted under which conditions differs, often only slightly, from one license to another.

Licenses are legal documents and written by legal experts. But you can choose an already written one that best suits your situation.
