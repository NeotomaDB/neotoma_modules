## How to Set Up a Presentation

- Open a new R Markdown file

- In the YAML header output specify `ioslides_presentation` 

- You can create a slide show broken up into sections by using the # and ## heading tags 

- A Slide without a header can be set by using a horizontal rule (---). 

- Code and text will be rendered: remember to use your code chunks options accordingly.

- Do the Next exercise to do your first R Markdown presentation
