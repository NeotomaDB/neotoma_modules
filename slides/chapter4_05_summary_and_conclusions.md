# Binder is ...

- Code sharing made easy

- You will never have to say again "but it ran in my computer"

- A Binder Repository contains at minimum two elements:
    - Code or content that you want people to be able to run. 
    - Configuration files for the environment.
    
- Binders Hubs allow you to deploy Juypter Notebooks and Rmd the easy way

If you want to launch some sample binders take a look at:

# Advantages of Binder

- Binder lets you share links to interactive data analytics environments. This is great for workshops, tutorials, and classes.
- Binder can provide interactivity to documentation and demonstrations of tools. 
- Binder can provide interactivity to readers, allowing them a more rich experience with your content.

---

# Limitations of Binder
- Each instance is limited to 2 gb of RAM and will get destroyed after 10 minutes of inactivity. 
- Each instance can run for a maximum of 24 hours before it will get killed.
- You can get around these limitations by hosting your own binder hub but this will require compute + devops resources from your side.
